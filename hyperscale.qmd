## Vision of HyperScaleEM

Electron microscopy is essential to understanding structure-property-function relationships in modern
materials engineering, condensed matter physics, chemistry, and structural biology. Yet, due to complicated
scattering physics, todayâ€™s electron microscopes can only image tiny volumes with 3D atomic resolution.
Within this project, I will turn the tables by utilizing and inverting the scattering physics to image scale-
bridging volumes with atomic detail and chemical superresolution. Combining compressive data-acquisition
protocols, state-of-the-art electron optics and detectors, and co-designed computational imaging algorithms
will make this possible.

I will use tomographic experiments and computationally invert the multiple scattering from multidimensional
measurements in scanning transmission electron microscopy to determine 3D atomic structure and chemistry
in technologically valuable volumes. This has not been realized yet due to significant bottlenecks in the
computational complexity of the underlying algorithms and a lack of experimental automation, which I plan to
overcome in this project.

The project is divided into three main objectives:

1) Imaging 3D atomic structure in large volumes
2) Visualizing atomic chemistry in scale-bridging volumes
3) Profiling 3D atomic structure, chemistry, and dynamics in controlled in-situ experiments across scales

These methods will be applied to essential materials, including examining single hydrogen atoms at grain
boundaries in structural metals and studying concealed, extensive interfaces in modern semiconductor
materials. In the final phase, I will record atomistic movies of material fracture in tungsten and alloys.
Fracture is one of the most critical failure modes of functional and structural materials with catastrophic
consequences. The details of crack nucleation and propagation through the breaking of bonds are still largely
unexplored and will be measured directly and compared with large-scale atomistic simulations.

## Hiring for HyperScaleEM

I am currently hiring a Postoc (2 years + 3 years) and a PhD student (4 years) for the HyperScaleEM project for a start on Nov 1st.
