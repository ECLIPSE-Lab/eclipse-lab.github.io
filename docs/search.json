    "text": "Abstract\nThree-dimensional atomic resolution imaging using transmission electron microscopes is a unique capability that requires challenging experiments. Linear electron tomography methods are limited by the missing wedge effect, requiring a high tilt range. Multislice ptychography can achieve deep sub-Ångstrom resolution in the transverse direction, but depth resolution is limited to 2 to 3 nanometers. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate an end-to-end approach to reconstructing the electrostatic potential volume of the sample directly from the 4D-STEM datasets. End-to-end multislice ptychographic tomography recovers several slices at each tomography tilt angle and compensates for the missing wedge effect. The algorithm is initially tested in simulation with a Pt@Al2O3 core–shell nanoparticle, where both heavy and light atoms are recovered in 3D from an unaligned 4D-STEM tilt series with a restricted tilt range of 90 degrees. We also demonstrate the algorithm experimentally, recovering a Te nanoparticle with sub-Ångstrom resolution."

    "text": "Abstract\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) is essential for determining atomic scale structures in structural biology and materials science. In structural biology, three-dimensional structures of proteins are routinely determined from thousands of identical particles using phase-contrast TEM. In materials science, three-dimensional atomic structures of complex nanomaterials have been determined using atomic electron tomography (AET). However, neither of these methods can determine the three-dimensional atomic structure of heterogeneous nanomaterials containing light elements. Here, we perform ptychographic electron tomography from 34.5 million diffraction patterns to reconstruct an atomic resolution tilt series of a double wall-carbon nanotube (DW-CNT) encapsulating a complex ZrTe sandwich structure. Class averaging the resulting tilt series images and subpixel localization of the atomic peaks reveals a Zr11Te50 structure containing a previously unobserved ZrTe2 phase in the core. The experimental realization of atomic resolution ptychographic electron tomography will allow for the structural determination of a wide range of beam-sensitive nanomaterials containing light elements."

    "text": "Abstract\nMetal-organic layers (MOLs) are highly attractive for application in catalysis, separation, sensing and biomedicine, owing to their tunable framework structure. However, it is challenging to obtain comprehensive information about the formation and local structures of MOLs using standard electron microscopy methods due to serious damage under electron beam irradiation. Here, we investigate the growth processes and local structures of MOLs utilizing a combination of liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy, cryogenic electron microscopy and electron ptychography. Our results show a multistep formation process, where precursor clusters first form in solution, then they are complexed with ligands to form non-crystalline solids, followed by the arrangement of the cluster-ligand complex into crystalline sheets, with additional possible growth by the addition of clusters to surface edges. Moreover, high-resolution imaging allows us to identify missing clusters, dislocations, loop and flat surface terminations and ligand connectors in the MOLs. Our observations provide insights into controllable MOL crystal morphology, defect engineering, and surface modification, thus assisting novel MOL design and synthesis."

    "text": "Abstract\nRecent work has revived interest in the scattering matrix formulation of electron scattering in transmission electron microscopy as a stepping stone toward atomic-resolution structure determination in the presence of multiple scattering. We discuss ways of visualizing the scattering matrix that make its properties clear. Through a simulation-based case study incorporating shot noise, we shown how regularizing on this continuity enables the scattering matrix to be reconstructed from 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements from a single defocus value. Intriguingly, for crystalline samples, this process also yields the sample thickness to nanometer accuracy with no a priori knowledge about the sample structure. The reconstruction quality is gauged by using the reconstructed scattering matrix to simulate STEM images at defocus values different from that of the data from which it was reconstructed."

    "text": "Abstract\nScanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is an extremely versatile method for studying materials on the atomic scale. Many STEM experiments are supported or validated with electron scattering simulations. However, using the conventional multislice algorithm to perform these simulations can require extremely large calculation times, particularly for experiments with millions of probe positions as each probe position must be simulated independently. Recently, the plane-wave reciprocal-space interpolated scattering matrix (PRISM) algorithm was developed to reduce calculation times for large STEM simulations. Here, we introduce a new method for STEM simulation: partitioning of the STEM probe into “beamlets,” given by a natural neighbor interpolation of the parent beams. This idea is compatible with PRISM simulations and can lead to even larger improvements in simulation time, as well requiring significantly less computer random access memory (RAM). We have performed various simulations to demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of partitioned PRISM STEM simulations. We find that this new algorithm is particularly useful for 4D-STEM simulations of large fields of view. We also provide a reference implementation of the multislice, PRISM, and partitioned PRISM algorithms."

We discuss the results in terms of the coincident kinetic energy of the photo electrons and the nuclear kinetic energy release of the recoiling ions. We have incorporated quantum chemistry calculations to interpret which of the electronic states of the dication have been populated and trace the various subsequent fragmentation channels. We suggest pathways that involve the electronic ground and excited states of the precursor ethylene dication and explore the strong inﬂuence of the conical intersections between the diﬀerent electronic states. The nondissociative ionization yield is small in ethylene and high in acetylene when compared with the dissociative ionization channels. The reason for such a striking diﬀerence is explained in part on the basis of a propensity rule which inﬂuences the population of states in the photo double ionization of a centrosymmetric closed shell molecule by favoring singlet ungerade and triplet gerade ﬁnal states. This propensity rule and the calculated potential energy surfaces clarify a picture of the dynamics leading to the observed dication dissociation products. PACS numbers: 33.80.Eh, 33.90.+h I. INTRODUCTION In the Photo Double Ionization (PDI) of a target atom or a molecule, one photon is absorbed by a single electron which then interacts with another electron, ejecting both into the continuum and producing one or more charged recoil ions. The essential interaction of the two electrons make PDI an ideal process for studying electron-electron correlation. Moreover, fragmentation dynamics can be investigated by connecting electronic states to diﬀerent dissociation channels. In past years, PDI has seen ex- tensive study on two electron systems such as H 2 and He with intra shell electron-electron correlation and on many electron diatomic molecules with both intra and in- ter shell electron-electron interactions (see, e.g. Refs. [1– 5]). The natural next step is to use polyatomic molecu- lar targets to explore the eﬀects of chemical bonding on electron-electron correlation. PDI of these targets also oﬀers a variety of avoided crossings and conical intersec- tions of Potential Energy Surfaces (PESs) that produce a rich array of nuclear dynamics during dissociation. We chose to study closed shell hydrocarbon molecules with diﬀerent types of hybridization of their carbon- carbon bond, namely ethylene (C 2 H 4 ) and acetylene (C 2 H 2 ). We expect PDI of these two species to be diﬀer- ent because of their dissimilar geometries and electronic conﬁgurations. The double ionization of these molecules with photon and particle impact has been explored heav- ily in the past both in theory and experiment (ethylene [6–8] and acetylene [9–16]). Previous studies in ethylene include methods like double-charge-transfer spectroscopy [7, 17, 18], charge-stripping-mass spectroscopy [19, 20], Auger spectroscopy [21, 22], and time-of-ﬂight mass spec- trometry [23–25]. In all these experiments the detection of the doubly charged ion C 2 H 4 2+ is elusive. This is due to the fact that the Time Of Flight (TOF) of the molec- ular dication and the fragment ions from other breakup channels overlap. The fragmentation pathways remain unidentiﬁed in these studies and a more sensitive probe is needed to pinpoint the existence of a stable dication in the direct PDI near threshold. Here we utilize a method that allows the coincidence detection of both electrons and the recoil ions produced by double ionization. We choose photon energies close to the PDI threshold where deviations from the Wannier law are expected to be small. By detecting the energies of all particles simultaneously we are able to verify that most electrons are emitted via direct double ionization and that any competing two-step processes such as au- toionization or Auger decay play a minor role. This en- ables the kinematically complete study of the direct PDI"

The advancement of in situ capabilities and new detector technologies have enabled to probe the dynamic evolution of materials under different stimuli, such as temperature, cryogenic conditions, in liquid and magnetic as well as electric fields with high spatial and temporal resolution. Furthermore, with the advent of pixelated, direct electron detectors, it has become possible to design novel imaging modalities by using the full diffraction information in each scan position, termed 4D-STEM. This technique opens the door to mappingcrystal orientations in nanomaterials, measuring strain with high spatial resolution or even imaging light elements in complex compounds at atomic resolution. Modern detectors’ increasing speed even allows combining in situ experiments with 4D-STEM or other spectroscopic techniques to holistically explore material evolution. The ever-growing data streams associated with such experiments also require the development of novel analysis algorithms. Fast and automated data analysis routines will provide on-the-fly feedback while performing the experiment and the implementation of machine-learning based tools will eventually facilitate an autonomous exploration of the data spaces providing pathways to new material discoveries.\nThe symposium aims to bring together experts in in situ and multimodal microscopies to address new developments in method and data analysis. The microscopy techniques include scanning and transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and related techniques. The focus also lies in developments combining in situ experiments with multimodal probing of materials and the advancement of novel data analysis and machine learning algorithms. More specifically the symposium focuses on:\n• Microscopy techniques, including scanning and transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, scanning probe microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy • In situ techniques that study materials exposed to strain, temperature, cryogenic conditions, electric and magnetic fields, in liquid or gas atmosphere • Developments in multimodal microscopy, such as 4D-STEM, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in combination with electron energy-loss spectroscopy or related methods • Advancements in automated and open source-based data analysis of multidimensional datasets or on-the-fly data analysis • Machine learning based tools for autonomous data analysis and data exploration, including supervised and unsupervised approaches, Gaussian processes, deep learning and related techniques • Metallic materials, functional oxides, nanomaterials, catalysts, surfaces, magnetic materials, quantum materials and related solid-state materials\n\n\n\nhttps://berlin24.dpg-tagungen.de/programm/abstract"

For X-ray ptychography, a scanning microscopy technique that provides nanometric resolution on extended fields of view, and the settling time of the scanning system is one of the bottlenecks for fast imaging. Here, we demonstrate that ptychographic on-the-fly scans, i.e., collecting diffraction patterns while the sample is scanned with constant velocity, can be modelled as a state mixture of the probing radiation and allow for reliable image recovery. Characteristics of the probe modes are discussed for various scan parameters, and the application to significantly reducing the scanning time is considered."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nElectron ptychography has seen a recent surge of interest for phase sensitive imaging at atomic or near-atomic resolution. However, applications are so far mainly limited to radiation-hard samples, because the required doses are too high for imaging biological samples at high resolution. We propose the use of non-convex Bayesian optimization to overcome this problem, and show via numerical simulations that the dose required for successful reconstruction can be reduced by two orders of magnitude compared to previous experiments. As an important application we suggest to use this method for imaging single biological macromolecules at cryogenic temperatures and demonstrate 2D single-particle reconstructions from simulated data with a resolution up to 5.4 Å at a dose of 20e − /Å2. When averaging over only 30 low-dose datasets, a 2D resolution around 3.5 Å is possible for macromolecular complexes even below 100 kDa. With its independence from the microscope transfer function, direct recovery of phase contrast, and better scaling of signal-to-noise ratio, low-dose cryo electron ptychography may become a promising alternative to Zernike phase-contrast microscopy."

    "text": "Abstract\nScanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) allows for imaging, diffraction, and spectroscopy of materials on length scales ranging from microns to atoms. By using a high-speed, direct electron detector, it is now possible to record a full two-dimensional (2D) image of the diffracted electron beam at each probe position, typically a 2D grid of probe positions. These 4D-STEM datasets are rich in information, including signatures of the local structure, orientation, deformation, electromagnetic fields, and other sample-dependent properties. However, extracting this information requires complex analysis pipelines that include data wrangling, calibration, analysis, and visualization, all while maintaining robustness against imaging distortions and artifacts. In this paper, we present py4DSTEM, an analysis toolkit for measuring material properties from 4D-STEM datasets, written in the Python language and released with an open-source license. We describe the algorithmic steps for dataset calibration and various 4D-STEM property measurements in detail and present results from several experimental datasets. We also implement a simple and universal file format appropriate for electron microscopy data in py4DSTEM, which uses the open-source HDF5 standard. We hope this tool will benefit the research community and help improve the standards for data and computational methods in electron microscopy, and we invite the community to contribute to this ongoing project."

    "text": "Abstract\nShape-controlled synthesis of multiply twinned nanostructures is heavily emphasized in nanoscience, in large part due to the desire to control the size, shape, and terminating facets of metal nanoparticles for applications in catalysis. Direct control of the size and shape of solution-grown nanoparticles relies on an understanding of how synthetic parameters alter nanoparticle structures during synthesis. However, while outcome populations can be effectively studied with standard electron microscopy methods, transient structures that appear during some synthetic routes are difficult to study using conventional high resolution imaging methods due to the high complexity of the 3D nanostructures. Here, we have studied the prevalence of transient structures during growth of multiply twinned particles and employed atomic electron tomography to reveal the atomic-scale three-dimensional structure of a Pd nanoparticle undergoing a shape transition. By identifying over 20 000 atoms within the structure and classifying them according to their local crystallographic environment, we observe a multiply twinned structure consistent with a simultaneous successive twinning from a decahedral to icosahedral structure."

With 4D-SCED, spot diffraction patterns form from an interaction area of a few nm while the electron beam rasters over the sample, resulting in high dose effectiveness yet highly demanding on the detector in frame speed, sensitivity, and single-pixel count rate. We compare the datasets acquired with 4D-SCED using a fast HPD with those using state-of-the-art complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) cameras to map the in-plane orientation of π-stacking nano-crystallites of small molecule DRCN5T in a blend of DRCN5T: PC71BM after solvent vapor annealing. The high-speed CMOS camera, using a scintillator optimized for low doses, showed impressive results for electron sensitivity and low noise. However, the limited speed restricted practical experimental conditions and caused unintended damage to small and weak nano-crystallites. The fast HPD, with a speed three orders of magnitude higher, allows a much higher probe current yet a lower total dose on the sample, and more scan points cover a large field of view in less time. A lot more faint diffraction signals that correspond to just a few electron events are detected. The improved performance of direct electron detectors opens more possibilities to enhance the characterization of beam-sensitive materials using 4D-STEM techniques."

    "text": "Abstract\nElectron ptychography is a powerful computational method for atomic-resolution imaging with high contrast for weakly and strongly scattering elements. Modern algorithms coupled with fast and efficient detectors allow imaging specimens with tens of nanometers thicknesses with sub-0.5 Ångstrom lateral resolution. However, the axial resolution in these approaches is currently limited to a few nanometers, limiting their ability to solve novel atomic structures ab initio. Here, we experimentally demonstrate multi-slice ptychographic electron tomography, which allows atomic resolution three-dimensional phase-contrast imaging in a volume surpassing the depth of field limits. We reconstruct tilt-series 4D-STEM measurements of a       Co 3   O 4      nanocube, yielding 2 Å axial and 0.7 Å transverse resolution in a reconstructed volume of      ( 18.2  nm  ) 3     . Our results demonstrate a 13.5-fold improvement in axial resolution compared to multi-slice ptychography while retaining the atomic lateral resolution and the capability to image volumes beyond the depth of field limit. Multi-slice ptychographic electron tomography significantly expands the volume of materials accessible using high-resolution electron microscopy. We discuss further experimental and algorithmic improvements necessary to also resolve single weakly scattering atoms in 3D."
