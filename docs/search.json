    "text": "Abstract\nOne approach to three-dimensional structure determination using the wealth of scattering data in four-dimensional (4D) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is the parallax method proposed by Ophus et al. (2019. Advanced phase reconstruction methods enabled by 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy, Microsc Microanal 25, 10–11), which determines the scattering matrix and uses it to synthesize a virtual depth-sectioning reconstruction of the sample structure. Drawing on an equivalence with a hypothetical confocal imaging mode, we derive contrast transfer and point spread functions for this parallax method applied to weakly scattering objects, showing them identical to earlier depth-sectioning STEM modes when only bright field signal is used, but that improved depth resolution is possible if dark field signal can be used. Through a simulation-based study of doped Si, we show that this depth resolution is preserved for thicker samples, explore the impact of shot noise on the parallax reconstructions, discuss challenges to making use of dark field signal, and identify cases where the interpretation of the parallax reconstruction breaks down."

    "text": "Abstract\nFour-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) has recently gained widespread attention for its ability to image atomic electric fields with sub-{}ngstrom spatial resolution. These electric field maps represent the integrated effect of the nucleus, core electrons and valence electrons, and separating their contributions is non-trivial. In this paper, we utilized simultaneously acquired 4D-STEM center of mass (CoM) images and annular dark field (ADF) images to determine the electron charge density in monolayer MoS2. We find that both the core electrons and the valence electrons contribute to the derived electron charge density. However, due to blurring by the probe shape, the valence electron contribution forms a nearly featureless background while most of the spatial modulation comes from the core electrons. Our findings highlight the importance of probe shape in interpreting charge densities derived from 4D STEM."

However, it is challenging to obtain comprehensive information about the formation and local structures of MOLs using standard electron microscopy methods due to serious damage under electron beam irradiation. Here, we investigate the growth processes and local structures of MOLs utilizing a combination of liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy, cryogenic electron microscopy and electron ptychography. Our results show a multistep formation process, where precursor clusters first form in solution, then they are complexed with ligands to form non-crystalline solids, followed by the arrangement of the cluster-ligand complex into crystalline sheets, with additional possible growth by the addition of clusters to surface edges.

    "text": "Abstract\nScanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), where a converged electron probe is scanned over a sample’s surface and an imaging, diffraction, or spectroscopic signal is measured as a function of probe position, is an extremely powerful tool for materials characterization. The widespread adoption of hardware aberration correction, direct electron detectors, and computational imaging methods have made STEM one of the most important tools for atomic-resolution materials science. Many of these imaging methods rely on accurate imaging and diffraction simulations in order to interpret experimental results. However, STEM simulations have traditionally required large calculation times, as modeling the electron scattering requires a separate simulation for each of the typically millions of probe positions. We have created the Prismatic simulation code for fast simulation of STEM experiments with support for multi-CPU and multi-GPU (graphics processing unit) systems, using both the conventional multislice and our recently-introduced PRISM method. In this paper, we introduce Prismatic version 2.0, which adds many new algorithmic improvements, an updated graphical user interface (GUI), post-processing of simulation data, and additional operating modes such as plane-wave TEM. We review various aspects of the simulation methods and codes in detail and provide various simulation examples. Prismatic 2.0 is freely available both as an open-source package that can be run using a C++ or Python command line interface, or GUI, as well within a Docker container environment."

    "text": "Abstract\nScanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is an extremely versatile method for studying materials on the atomic scale. Many STEM experiments are supported or validated with electron scattering simulations. However, using the conventional multislice algorithm to perform these simulations can require extremely large calculation times, particularly for experiments with millions of probe positions as each probe position must be simulated independently. Recently, the plane-wave reciprocal-space interpolated scattering matrix (PRISM) algorithm was developed to reduce calculation times for large STEM simulations. Here, we introduce a new method for STEM simulation: partitioning of the STEM probe into “beamlets,” given by a natural neighbor interpolation of the parent beams. This idea is compatible with PRISM simulations and can lead to even larger improvements in simulation time, as well requiring significantly less computer random access memory (RAM). We have performed various simulations to demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of partitioned PRISM STEM simulations. We find that this new algorithm is particularly useful for 4D-STEM simulations of large fields of view. We also provide a reference implementation of the multislice, PRISM, and partitioned PRISM algorithms."

    "text": "Abstract\nDue to the advent of direct electron-counting detectors and improvements in algorithms, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has rapidly developed into a mainstream technique for solving the structures of biological macromolecules. The key to improving the resolution even further lies in measuring more effectively the phase shift which the molecules impart on the high-energy electron wave. In a previous paper [1] we have shown that, with the help of multi-slice simulations, electron ptychography in combination with Bayesian reconstruction algorithms provides up to two orders of magnitude improvement in signal-to-noise ratio at 3 Å resolution compared to Zernike-type phase contrast and phase contrast from defocus aberration. Therefore, ptychography may become a more efficient alternative to conventional phase contrast imaging methods in cryo-EM. Recently Pennycook et al.[2] showed that single side-band …"

    "text": "Abstract\nElectron ptychography has seen a recent surge of interest for phase sensitive imaging at atomic or near-atomic resolution. However, applications are so far mainly limited to radiation-hard samples, because the required doses are too high for imaging biological samples at high resolution. We propose the use of non-convex Bayesian optimization to overcome this problem, and show via numerical simulations that the dose required for successful reconstruction can be reduced by two orders of magnitude compared to previous experiments. As an important application we suggest to use this method for imaging single biological macromolecules at cryogenic temperatures and demonstrate 2D single-particle reconstructions from simulated data with a resolution up to 5.4 Å at a dose of 20e −/Å2. When averaging over only 30 low-dose datasets, a 2D resolution around 3.5 Å is possible for macromolecular complexes even below 100 kDa. With its independence from the microscope transfer function, direct recovery of phase contrast, and better scaling of signal-to-noise ratio, low-dose cryo electron ptychography may become a promising alternative to Zernike phase-contrast microscopy."

The advancement of in situ capabilities and new detector technologies have enabled to probe the dynamic evolution of materials under different stimuli, such as temperature, cryogenic conditions, in liquid and magnetic as well as electric fields with high spatial and temporal resolution. Furthermore, with the advent of pixelated, direct electron detectors, it has become possible to design novel imaging modalities by using the full diffraction information in each scan position, termed 4D-STEM. This technique opens the door to mappingcrystal orientations in nanomaterials, measuring strain with high spatial resolution or even imaging light elements in complex compounds at atomic resolution. Modern detectors’ increasing speed even allows combining in situ experiments with 4D-STEM or other spectroscopic techniques to holistically explore material evolution. The ever-growing data streams associated with such experiments also require the development of novel analysis algorithms. Fast and automated data analysis routines will provide on-the-fly feedback while performing the experiment and the implementation of machine-learning based tools will eventually facilitate an autonomous exploration of the data spaces providing pathways to new material discoveries.\nThe symposium aims to bring together experts in in situ and multimodal microscopies to address new developments in method and data analysis. The microscopy techniques include scanning and transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and related techniques. The focus also lies in developments combining in situ experiments with multimodal probing of materials and the advancement of novel data analysis and machine learning algorithms. More specifically the symposium focuses on:\n• Microscopy techniques, including scanning and transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, scanning probe microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy • In situ techniques that study materials exposed to strain, temperature, cryogenic conditions, electric and magnetic fields, in liquid or gas atmosphere • Developments in multimodal microscopy, such as 4D-STEM, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in combination with electron energy-loss spectroscopy or related methods • Advancements in automated and open source-based data analysis of multidimensional datasets or on-the-fly data analysis • Machine learning based tools for autonomous data analysis and data exploration, including supervised and unsupervised approaches, Gaussian processes, deep learning and related techniques • Metallic materials, functional oxides, nanomaterials, catalysts, surfaces, magnetic materials, quantum materials and related solid-state materials\n\n\n\nhttps://berlin24.dpg-tagungen.de/programm/abstract"

For X-ray ptychography, a scanning microscopy technique that provides nanometric resolution on extended fields of view, and the settling time of the scanning system is one of the bottlenecks for fast imaging. Here, we demonstrate that ptychographic on-the-fly scans, i.e., collecting diffraction patterns while the sample is scanned with constant velocity, can be modelled as a state mixture of the probing radiation and allow for reliable image recovery. Characteristics of the probe modes are discussed for various scan parameters, and the application to significantly reducing the scanning time is considered."

In this work, we present an algorithm using the scattering matrix formalism to solve the scattering from a noncrystalline medium from scanning diffraction measurements and simultaneously recover the illumination aberrations. We demonstrate our method experimentally in a scanning transmission electron microscope, recovering the scattering matrix of a heterogeneous sample with two layers of multiwall carbon nanotubes filled with TaTe 2 core-shell structures, spaced 10 nm apart in the axial direction. Our work enables phase contrast imaging and materials characterization in multiply-scattering samples at high resolution for a wide range of materials."

    "text": "Abstract\nScanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is an extremely versatile method for studying materials on the atomic scale. Many STEM experiments are supported or validated with electron scattering simulations. However, using the conventional multislice algorithm to perform these simulations can require extremely large calculation times, particularly for experiments with millions of probe positions as each probe position must be simulated independently. Recently, the plane-wave reciprocal-space interpolated scattering matrix (PRISM) algorithm was developed to reduce calculation times for large STEM simulations. Here, we introduce a new method for STEM simulation: partitioning of the STEM probe into “beamlets,” given by a natural neighbor interpolation of the parent beams. This idea is compatible with PRISM simulations and can lead to even larger improvements in simulation time, as well requiring significantly less computer random access memory (RAM). We have performed various simulations to demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of partitioned PRISM STEM simulations. We find that this new algorithm is particularly useful for 4D-STEM simulations of large fields of view. We also provide a reference implementation of the multislice, PRISM, and partitioned PRISM algorithms."

However, while outcome populations can be effectively studied with standard electron microscopy methods, transient structures that appear during some synthetic routes are difficult to study using conventional high resolution imaging methods due to the high complexity of the 3D nanostructures. Here, we have studied the prevalence of transient structures during growth of multiply twinned particles and employed atomic electron tomography to reveal the atomic-scale three-dimensional structure of a Pd nanoparticle …"

    "text": "Abstract\nThe arrival of direct electron detectors (DEDs) with high frame rates in the field of scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has enabled many experimental techniques that require collection of a full diffraction pattern at each scan position, a field which is subsumed under the name four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy ( 4D-STEM ). DED frame rates approaching 100 kHz require data transmission rates and data storage capabilities that exceed those of the commonly available computing infrastructures. Current commercial DEDs allow the user to make compromises in pixel bit depth, detector binning, or windowing to reduce the per-frame file size and allow higher frame rates. This change in detector specifications requires decisions to be made before data acquisition that may reduce or lose information that could have been advantageous during data analysis."

    "text": "Abstract\nFour-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) has recently gained widespread attention for its ability to image atomic electric fields with sub-Angstrom spatial resolution. These electric field maps represent the integrated effect of the nucleus, core electrons and valence electrons, and separating their contributions is non-trivial. In this paper, we utilized simultaneously acquired 4D-STEM center of mass (CoM) images and annular dark field (ADF) images to determine the electron charge density in monolayer MoS2. We find that both the core electrons and the valence electrons contribute to the derived electron charge density. However, due to blurring by the probe shape, the valence electron contribution forms a nearly featureless background while most of the spatial modulation comes from the core electrons. Our findings highlight the importance of probe shape in interpreting charge densities derived from 4D STEM."

    "text": "Abstract\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) is essential for determining atomic scale structures in structural biology and materials science. In structural biology, three-dimensional structures of proteins are routinely determined from thousands of identical particles using phase-contrast TEM. In materials science, three-dimensional atomic structures of complex nanomaterials have been determined using atomic electron tomography (AET). However, neither of these methods can determine the three-dimensional atomic structure of heterogeneous nanomaterials containing light elements. Here, we perform ptychographic electron tomography from 34.5 million diffraction patterns to reconstruct an atomic resolution tilt series of a double wall-carbon nanotube (DW-CNT) encapsulating a complex ZrTe sandwich structure. Class averaging the resulting tilt series images and subpixel localization of the atomic peaks reveals a Zr11Te50 structure containing a previously unobserved ZrTe2 phase in the core. The experimental realization of atomic resolution ptychographic electron tomography will allow for the structural determination of a wide range of beam-sensitive nanomaterials containing light elements."
