## Research Topics

### Computational imaging

- **Large-scale dose-efficient 3D imaging**

  We are leaders in the development of 3D imaging methods based on 4D-STEM measurements. 

    - [2023: first atomic-resolution 3D volume from 4D-STEM tomography](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43634-z) 
    - [2024: first atomic-resolution phase-contrast volume beyond the depth of focus limit](https://doi.org/10.1088/2515-7639/ad9ad2)
    - [2024: first end-to-end reconstruction reaching sub-Angstrom resolution](https://doi.org/10.1088/1402-4896/ad9a1a)

  These methods will enable high-throughput, high-resolution, and high-sensitivity 3D imaging of large samples. Especially weakly scattering atoms can be resolved with unprecedented accuracy.

- **Fast simulators for electron microscopy** 

  We are developing fast simulators for electron microscopy.

  - [\>100x faster simulations](https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/27/4/835/6888048)

### Multi-modal microscopy

We are developing new approaches for multi-modal 3D imaging, down to the atomic scale.

Stay tuned for the first results!

### Self-driving equipment

We are developing automation methods for electron microscopy.

Stay tuned for the first results!

## Research Framework

### Holistic microscopy - using as much of the scattering information as possible

The substantive focus of our work is on incorporating prior physical knowledge about scattering mechanisms and multiple signal channels into the image reconstruction.

### ML-driven microscopy

We use modern machine learning tools to make microscopy faster and better
