## Research Framework

### Holistic microscopy - using as much of the scattering information as possible

The substantive focus of our work is on incorporating prior physical knowledge about scattering mechanisms and multiple signal channels into the image reconstruction.

### ML-driven microscopy

We use modern machine learning tools to make microscopy faster and better
