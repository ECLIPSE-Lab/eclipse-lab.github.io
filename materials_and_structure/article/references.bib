The basis for the extension lies in the possibility of introducing a virtual lattice, which can be treated as in parts I and II when working with a primary wave field that has zero amplitude outside a given spatial region. Thus it becomes possible to form an image without the use of a lens in a manner similar to holography but based on different principles. A reference wave (as used in holography) is not required. The new principle can be applied in a number of variations, some of which are discussed.}, note={00065}, number={4}, journal={Acta Crystallographica Section A: Crystal Physics, Diffraction, Theoretical and General Crystallography}, author={Hoppe, W.}, year={1969}, month={Jul}, pages={508–514} }

However, to date almost all of the attoscience experiments have been based on spectroscopic measurements because attosecond pulses have intrinsically very broad spectra due to the uncertainty principle and are incompatible with conventional imaging systems. Here we report an important advance towards achieving attosecond coherent diffractive imaging. Using simulated attosecond pulses, we simultaneously reconstruct the spectrum, 17 probes, and 17 spectral images of extended objects from a set of ptychographic diffraction patterns. We further confirm the principle and feasibility of this method by successfully performing a ptychographic coherent diffractive imaging experiment using a light-emitting diode with a broad spectrum. We believe this work clears the way to an unexplored domain of attosecond imaging science, which could have a far-reaching impact across different disciplines.}, number={8}, journal={Physical Review Letters}, publisher={American Physical Society}, author={Rana, A. and Zhang, J. and Pham, M. and Yuan, A. and Lo, Yuan-Hung and Jiang, H. and Osher, S.

However, for conventional imaging methods in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), atomic resolution with picometer precision cannot usually be achieved for weakly-scattering samples or radiation-sensitive materials, such as 2D materials. Here, we demonstrate low-dose, sub-angstrom resolution imaging with picometer precision using mixed-state electron ptychography. We show that correctly accounting for the partial coherence of the electron beam is a prerequisite for high-quality structural reconstructions due to the intrinsic partial coherence of the electron beam. The mixed-state reconstruction gains importance especially when simultaneously pursuing high resolution, high precision and large field-of-view imaging. Compared with conventional atomic-resolution STEM imaging techniques, the mixed-state ptychographic approach simultaneously provides a four-times-faster acquisition, with double the information limit at the same dose, or up to a fifty-fold reduction in dose at the same resolution.}, number={11}, journal={Nature Communications}, publisher={Nature Publishing Group}, author={Chen, Z. and Odstrcil, M. and Jiang, Y. and Han, Y. and Chiu, M.-H. and Li, L.-J. and Muller, D.

However, it has been realised experimentally that a major weakness of the approach is that the obtainable resolution is only as good as the accuracy to which the illuminating beam can be moved relative to the specimen. This can be catastrophic in the electron case because of thermal drift and hysteresis in the probe scan coils. We present here a computationally efficient extension of the ‘ePIE’ ptychographic reconstruction algorithm for correcting these errors retrospectively. We demonstrate its effectiveness using simulations and results from visible light and electron beam experiments that show it can correct positioning errors tens of times larger than the pixel size in the resulting image.}, journal={Ultramicroscopy}, author={Maiden, A.

Limited validity of these assumptions results in deterioration of the reconstruction quality. We present a generalized ptychography method that optimizes the reconstruction along multiple directions. In our manuscript, we demonstrate that the additional flexibility not only helps to amend imprecisions of the ptychography model in a self-consistent way but additionally leads to faster convergence without a significant increase of the computational cost per iteration.}, number={3}, journal={Optics Express}, author={Odstrčil, M. and Menzel, A. and Guizar-Sicairos, M.}, year={2018}, month={Feb}, pages={3108–3123} }

It offers the possibility to study relatively thick samples by using high energy X-ray photons and exploiting the phase contrast. However, the limited depth of field forces a compromise between resolution and sample thickness. Multi-slice techniques have been used to account for propagation effects within the sample, enabling imaging beyond the depth-of-field limit. Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate our multi-slice algorithms that allow for the reconstruction of multiple object slices and the incident illumination, as well as the retrieval of unknown object thickness. Additionally, through numerical studies, we show that smaller scanning steps surprisingly increase the depth of field, which can be further extended by the use of multi-slice methods under conditions stated by theoretical expressions.

It is based on a series of measurements for specific well determined orientations of the incident beam, which determine the moduli of all elements of the scattering matrix. Using unitarity and the specific form of the scattering matrix (including symmetries), an overdetermined set of non-linear equations is obtained from these data. Solution of these equations yields the required phase information and allows the determination of a (projected) crystal potential by inversion that is unique up to an arbitrary shift of the origin. The reconstruction of potentials from intensities is illustrated for two realistic examples, a {111} systematic row case in ZnS and a [110] zone-axis orientation in GaAs (both noncentrosymmetric crystals).}, number={44}, journal={Acta Crystallographica Section A: Foundations of Crystallography}, publisher={International Union of Crystallography}, author={Allen, L.

 @article{Pryor_Ophus_Miao_2017, title={A Streaming Multi-GPU Implementation of Image Simulation Algorithms for Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08563}, abstractNote={Simulation of atomic resolution image formation in scanning transmission electron microscopy can require significant computation times using traditional methods. A recently developed method, termed plane-wave reciprocal-space interpolated scattering matrix (PRISM), demonstrates potential for significant acceleration of such simulations with negligible loss of accuracy. Here we present a software package called Prismatic for parallelized simulation of image formation in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) using both the PRISM and multislice methods. By distributing the workload between multiple CUDA-enabled GPUs and multicore processors, accelerations as high as 1000x for PRISM and 30x for multislice are achieved relative to traditional multislice implementations using a single 4-GPU machine. We demonstrate a potentially important application of Prismatic, using it to compute images for atomic electron tomography at sufficient speeds to include in the reconstruction pipeline. Prismatic is freely available both as an open-source CUDA/C++ package with a graphical user interface and as a Python package, PyPrismatic.}, journal={arXiv:1706.08563 [physics]}, author={Pryor Jr., Alan and Ophus, Colin and Miao, Jianwei}, year={2017}, month={Jun} }
