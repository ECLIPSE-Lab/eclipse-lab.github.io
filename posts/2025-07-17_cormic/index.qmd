## About the Position

We are seeking a highly motivated PhD student to join the **CorMic Graduate School** at Friedrich-Alexander-Universit채t Erlangen-N체rnberg (FAU) for an exciting doctoral project focused on **dose-efficient data fusion for crystalline mapping and imaging of functional thin films**.

**Starting Date:** April 1, 2026  
**Duration:** 4 years  
**Location:** Erlangen, Germany

## Project Overview

This doctoral project (DP 1) aims to develop cutting-edge **physics-informed data fusion algorithms** that correlate local crystallinity, crystal orientation, and chemical information from 4D-STEM and 4D-STEM-in-SEM experiments. The primary goal is to significantly enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of measurements and apply these methods in experimental settings.

### Key Research Areas

#### 1. Multi-modal Data Fusion


- Develop algorithms to fuse elastic and inelastic spectroscopic signals in STEM
- Enhance SNR through correlation of multiple measurement channels
- Extract local structure-property information from functional thin films

#### 2. Beam-sensitive Materials Analysis


- Focus on organic thin films that require low-dose imaging
- Implement dose-efficient measurement strategies
- Preserve sample integrity while maximizing information extraction

#### 3. Specific Applications:


- **Inorganic semiconductor layers**  
- **Organic absorber layers and electrolyzers**  
- **3D correlation studies combining SECM-AFM and 4D-STEM:**  

#### 4. Validation and Comparison

- Compare developed approaches with ensemble statistics from spatially averaging X-ray scattering measurements
- Validate methods against established techniques

## Your Profile
