The Computational Microscopy group of Prof. Dr. Philipp Pelz at FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg offers a position as 

## Ph.D. Student Computational Imaging in Electron Microscopy (m/f/x) 
**(subject to personal qualifications, remuneration according to salary group E 13 TV-L 75-100%)**

starting September 15th 2024 or earliest date possible. 

Position and tasks

-	Develop and test new approaches and algorithms for large-scale multi-dimensional, multi-modal reconstruction of electron-microscopy datasets at the atomic-, nano-, and microscale
-	Design, optimize, and execute multidimensional STEM experiments
-	Publish and present the results of these studies to the community.

Position Requirements

-	M.Sc. in computer science, computational engineering, physical sciences, materials science, applied mathematics or a related discipline.
-	Proficiency in scientific Python programming.
-	Excellent communication and interpersonal skills to be able to interact effectively with a diverse group of scien-tists and technical staff.
-	Self-motivated and able to work in a team environment.

Preferred Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (experience in one or more of the following):

-	Experience with machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Jax
-	Background in diffraction physics, crystallography, or modern microscopy methods 
-	Data acquisition at aberration-corrected STEMs
-	Developing and deploying AI models.
-	Background in Computer Vision or Computational Imaging
-	Demonstrated record of collaborative software development, especially in distributed teams.

Our group develops advanced algorithms for efficient processing, reliable reconstruction, and automated information extraction from multidimensional microscopy datasets, predominantly in electron and X-ray microscopy. 

We have for the first time reconstructed large phase-contrast volumes at atomic resolution beyond the traditional limits of electron microscopy. 

You project will revolve around further developing the algorithms and applying them to image challenging materials systems, like metal-organic frameworks and other beam-sensitive materials. 

We offer access to state-of-the-art aberration-corrected electron microscopes and a lab-based x-ray microscope at the Center for Nanoanalysis and Electron Microscopy, access to high-performance computing resources at the Erlangen National High-Performance Computing Center, and the enthusiastic support of an early-career principal investigator.

For informal inquiries, please get in touch with Philipp Pelz (philipp.pelz@fau.de). Applications from underrepresented minorities are particularly welcome. Your application (in English or German) must include a motivation letter and your CV.

Applications will be accepted until the position is filled.
