The Computational Microscopy group of Prof. Dr. Philipp Pelz at FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg offers a position as 

## Ph.D. Student (Dr. Ing.) Computational Imaging in Electron Microscopy (m/f/x) 
**(subject to personal qualifications, remuneration according to salary group E 13 TV-L 75% (approx. 2300 EUR/month after taxes))**

starting Nov 1st 2024 or earliest date possible. 

Position and tasks

-	Develop and test new approaches and algorithms for large-scale multi-dimensional, multi-modal reconstruction of electron-microscopy datasets at the atomic scale
-	Design, optimize, and execute multidimensional STEM experiments at our Spectra 30-200 microscope equipped with an DECTRIS ARINA direct electron detector
-	Publish and present the results of these studies to the community.

Position Requirements

-	M.Sc. in physical sciences (preferred), computer science, computational engineering, materials science, applied mathematics or a related discipline.
-	Proficiency in scientific Python programming.
-	Excellent communication and interpersonal skills to be able to interact effectively with a diverse group of scien-tists and technical staff.
-	Self-motivated and able to work in a team environment.

Preferred Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (experience in one or more of the following):

-	Experience with machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Jax
-	Background in diffraction physics, crystallography, or modern microscopy methods 
-	Data acquisition at aberration-corrected STEMs
-	Developing and deploying AI models.
-	Background in Computer Vision or Computational Imaging
-	Demonstrated record of collaborative software development, especially in distributed teams.

Our group develops advanced algorithms for efficient processing, reliable reconstruction, and automated information extraction from multidimensional microscopy datasets, predominantly in electron and X-ray microscopy. 

We have for the first time reconstructed large phase-contrast volumes at atomic resolution beyond the traditional limits of electron microscopy. 

The HyperScaleEM project aims at extending the technique to large-volume reconstructions of the typical sample geometries in electron microscopy. Think: imaging whole transistors in 3D, visualizing every atom and it's element. 

We offer access to state-of-the-art aberration-corrected electron microscopes (TFS Spectra 30-200, ARINA detector, CEOS CEFID filter) at the Center for Nanoanalysis and Electron Microscopy, access to high-performance computing resources at the Erlangen National High-Performance Computing Center, and the enthusiastic support of an early-career principal investigator.

For informal inquiries, please get in touch with Philipp Pelz (philipp.pelz@fau.de). Applications from underrepresented minorities are particularly welcome. Your application (in English or German) must include a motivation letter and your CV.

The position is limited to 4 years.

Applications will be accepted until the position is filled.
