The Computational Microscopy group of Prof. Dr. Philipp Pelz at FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg offers a position as 

## Ph.D. Student Computational Imaging in Electron Microscopy (m/f/x) 
**(subject to personal qualifications, remuneration according to salary group E 13 TV-L 75%)**

starting September 15th 2024 or earliest date possible. 

Position and tasks 
·	Develop and test new approaches for real-time 3D imaging in the electron microscope
·	Develop approaches for sample-adaptive imaging and diffraction
·	Design, optimize, and execute Computational Electron Microscopy experiments at our state-of-the-art micro-scopes
·	Publish and present the results of these studies to the community.

Position Requirements
·	M.Sc. in computer science, computational engineering, physical sciences, applied mathematics or a related dis-cipline.
·	Proficiency in scientific Python programming.
·	Experience with machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch, Jax
·	Excellent communication and interpersonal skills to be able to interact effectively with a diverse group of scien-tists and technical staff.
·	Self-motivated and able to work in a team environment.

Preferred Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (experience in two or more of the following):
·	Background in diffraction physics, crystallography, or modern microscopy methods 
·	Data acquisition at aberration-corrected STEMs
·	Developing and deploying AI models.
·	Background in Computer Vision or Computational Imaging
·	Demonstrated record of collaborative software development, especially in distributed teams.


Our group develops advanced algorithms for efficient processing, reliable reconstruction, and automated information extraction from multidimensional microscopy datasets, predominantly in electron and X-ray microscopy. We have ex-pertise in deep learning, large-scale optimization, signal and image processing, and experimental design for advanced X-ray and electron microscopy experiments. 
We have for the first time reconstructed large phase-contrast volumes at atomic resolution beyond the traditional limits of electron microscopy and hold the resolution record for 3D phase-contrast imaging. 
We offer access to state-of-the-art aberration-corrected electron microscopes and a lab-based x-ray microscope at the Center for Nanoanalysis and Electron Microscopy, access to high-performance computing resources at the Erlangen National High-Performance Computing Center, and the enthusiastic support of an early-career principal investigator.

For informal inquiries, please get in touch with Philipp Pelz (philipp.pelz@fau.de). Applications from underrepresented minorities are particularly welcome. Your application (in English or German) must include a motivation letter and your CV. Applications will be accepted until the position is filled.
